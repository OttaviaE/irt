# IRT

This presentation deals with Rasch modeling and Item Response Theory (dicothomous and poltytomous data). 

The illustration starts from the intuition of Georg Rasch, explains the basic concepts of Rasch modeling and stresses the conceptual differences between Rasch and IRT modeing. The foucs is mostly on the information that can be retrieved at the item level and on its relationship with the person and the latent trait. 

Finally, a brief overview of the IRT models for polytomous data is given.
